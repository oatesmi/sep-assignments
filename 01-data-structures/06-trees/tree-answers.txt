1.  Difference between the heap and the binary tree is that the heap is easier to
  manually search through.  While there is structure to both, looking over the
  BST, the pattern is less apparent.  Min Heap is not totally sorted, but there
  is an apparent structure.

2.  Average insertion: 610x faster with Heap
    Average search: 2x faster with Heap
    Average deletion: .75x faster with BST

    You would use the BST if you were unsure of the exact value of what you were
    searching for and had a large amount of data to sift through. For example,
    searching a large array to see if a single value exists.

    You would use the Heap if you were unsure of any of the values, but had an
    idea of where the data you seek is in relation to the data set. For example,
    searching a large data set by rankings, or some other arbitrary way to sort
    keys and values.
